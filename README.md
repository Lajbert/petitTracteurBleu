# About

You are Little Blue Tractor and your goal is to find all the cows and bring them back home before night falls (the game lasts about 3 mins).

“Petit Tracteur Bleu” is a game I created for my 2.5 years old son, Gabriel, because he loves tractors. So please, don’t expect anything crazy here, it’s just a very simple game :)

It was designed to be played by someone who never played a video game before, and most movements are automated. The manual jump mechanic is only useful to explore hidden areas (using bumpers).
